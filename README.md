Due: Week 13 @11:59pm


Description:

Believe it or not, there was a time before the internet, and they had products
too! For this project you will need to take a product that was available before
1994 and create the front end of an online store (e-commerce). You may work
solo or in a pair for this project.
As you work though this project be sure to read and follow the instructions
carefully!


Submitting Your Work:

Please read and follow the instructions carefully.
• Upload the assignment folder to your GitHub repository. If the
repository is public then just the link is needed, if the repository is
private then you must also send an invitation to me as a collaborator.
• Upload your assignment folder to your Lamp Stack.
• Provide the links to both your GitHub and Lamp Stack to the Blackboard
submission.


Instructions:

Please read and follow the instructions below carefully:
• Do a search for a product before 1994, wiki would be a great place to
look.
• Gather all the content that you will need to complete the project, this

• Create a global header and footer using either JavaScript or jQuery.
• Create an organized file hierarchy, this means files should be named
appropriately and nested in the correct directories.
• Style your website using CSS. All the CSS should be contained to one
CSS file and there should be no inline CSS or embedded CSS.
• Use JavaScript or jQuery to listen for user events to add some user
interaction to the website.
