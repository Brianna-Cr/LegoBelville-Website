        <h2>About Lego Belville</h2>
        <p>
            LEGO Belville was introduced in 1994 with the goal of inspiring imagination and creativity play in children.
            Originally founded by <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/history" target="_blank">Ole Kirk Kristiansen</a>, LEGO's goal has always been to fuel creativity and encourage endless free play.
            LEGO Belville was specifically designed as a toy line aimed at girls, featuring our famous multi-jointed dollies and a signature color scheme of soft pinks and purples.
        <p>
            LEGO Belville released 88 sets in total, including charming creations such as playhouses, princess rooms, play-parks, nurseries, and many more!
            These sets were designed to allow children to build and explore magical, imaginative worlds.
            While only a few sets are displayed here, you can find many more at your local retailer, each offering a unique way to create stories and adventures!
        <p>
            Though LEGO Belville was discontinued in 2009, its spirit of imaginative play continued through our successor, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-ca/themes/friends" target="_blank">LEGO Friends</a>, which was introduced in 2012.
            LEGO Friends picked up where Belville left off, offering girls a new way to engage in creative building and play with modern characters and settings.
